This is an HTML simulation of the flight of the house in the animated movie "Up" I created during a university project to see how many balloons would actually be needed to allow the house to fly. Change the values of the sliders to see how the number of 
balloons, the mass of the house and the initial height above 
sea level affects the flight. If the red dot doesn't move, try
lowering the mass of the house or try adding more balloons.

As a benchmark for how much a typical house might weigh, the Seattle Times has a lower estimate of around 80,000 pounds / 36,000 kg. https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20041219&slug=homehay19#:~:text=(That%20would%20be%20one%20awfully,components%20(but%20not%20always)

If the house in "Up" weighed this much, it would require roughly 2,500,000 balloons to lift it!
